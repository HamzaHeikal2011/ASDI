## Readings Guide

Using the standard Arduino-IDE's Serial Plotter, you'll find 6 Values labeled A through F, each representing the Accelerometer/Gyroscope's X, Y and Z values. They are sorted according to this table:

    ------------------------------
    |     GYRO     |   ACCELL    |
    ------------------------------
    | X:    A      |      D      |
    ------------------------------
    | Y:    B      |      E      |
    ------------------------------
    | Z:    C      |      F      |
    ------------------------------

The fingers, however, are much more simpler, each potentiometer sensor value being labeled according to the finger they belong to
